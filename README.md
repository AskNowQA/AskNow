# AskNow
AskNow is a Question Answering (QA) system for RDF data sets. The system first normalizes Natural Language (English) query into an intermediary canonical syntactic form, called Normalized Query Structure (NQS), and then translated into SPARQL queries. NQS helps in identifying the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship. At the same time, it is sufficiently adaptive to query paraphrasing.
